Q1) Software Process Activities
Software Process Activities include

Software Specification which is Defining the problem/requirements and Planning the solution for those requirements which is step 1 and 2 in the SDLC

Software Development is the actual programatic implementation of the planned solution which is step 3 (coding) of the SDLC

Software Validation is the testing and fixing of the bugs before deployment it is step 4 (Testing) in the SDLC

Software Evolution is the support and maintainance of the developed Software, which could be in the form of documentation or customer Support of wikis etc, It is the last part of the SDLC(Documentation).



Q2 What is Software Engineering.

Software Engineering is an Engineering discipline, which provides tools or methods to execute the whole Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC).
It is concerned from Planning the Software to providing support and maintainence after development and deployement




Q3 Compare Software Engineering to building a house

If we build a house without proper planning and maintenance the chances of something going wrong increases by a lot
imagine if the architect completed the building plans as the building was being built, if we needed to change something then we would have to demolish the constructued part and reconstrut it , similarly if we build software without any planning then if some change is required we might have to rewrite that whole module again.
Similarly without maintaining the house after construction it will soon be unable to live in because utilities require maintainance to function, if we write software and dont provide support after development, it will lead to more bugs and vulneribilities arising leading to software being unusable.

Q4 Why Software Products Fail.

Software Products fail because of many reasons but one of the most common reason seen is the failure to adapt proper Software Engineering Methodologies and SDLC, which leads to more bugs and fixing costs and more support costs

Q5)Diff b/w Generic Software and Customized Software.

Imagine you are buying a suit, you have two options. Either buy an off-the-rack suit from a store or have a tailor made a custom suit
The off the rack suit will be cheaper, lower in quality and has a lower chance of fitting perfectly.
While the Custom made suit will be more expensive but higher in quality and will fit almost perfectly most of the time, and if there are any problems, the tailor will provide more support than those at store
Similarly General Softwares are developed for mass-consumers likes games, utility tools,Operating Systems etc, they cost generally less than the Customized Software but the room for customization is slim-to-none.
Customized Software is developed for one particular Consumer or Company, they are more expensive but come with high support and high customization options. Examples include: Software for the Flight Computer in the planes etc.

Q6) Attributes of a Good Software:
Good Software is a software which is
as bugfree as possible
Adapt to different devices and screens without changing the code
It is Secure so that all the data is safe 
Is a Scalable System so that a large Number of user dont crash the systems

Q7) Issues that affect Software
Some of the Issues are as follows
